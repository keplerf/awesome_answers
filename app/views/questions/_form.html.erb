<%# form_for is a Rails built-in form helper which generates a form that integegrates
    nicely with a matching controller (in this case questions_controller).
    Case 1: if @question is not persisted (not yet saved to the database), then
            form_for will make the form send a `POST` request to `questions_path`
            which should be defined to submit to questions controller / create action.
            Also, if you have any attributes pre-set on any of the @question
            fields (such as title or body). it will be pre-populate those fields.
            One more thing, it will also add a special class if there happens to be
            errors on a specific field
 %>

 <%# this will look for a partial names `_form.html.erb` within the same folder
 as this file.
 If you want to render the partial from another folder you can use the full
 path (with in the views folder) such as: render "/questions/form"
 Partials have access to the instance variables available in the template. So
 In this case @question will be available in _form.html.erb.
 If you want to pass a local variable to the partial then you can do:
 = render "form", abc: "Hello"
 Then you will have a variable named `abc` available in `_form` with value "Hello"
